      The most challenging part of the assignment was dealing with the array of "twits" it was not easy for me to conceptualize passing these into the handlesbars and how to properly setup the twits so they would be grouped with their authors. It turned out that the way that I guessed it would work ended up being the correct way though, so most of that struggle was just while initialy writing the code.  
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I learned about good design practices and how to not have to retype code for each different page I'm visiting. It felt like good tools to have and was overall a pretty enjoyable assignment. I think that the experience with express is going to be invaluable for the future.
      <br/>

      The most valuable resource here was certainly the handlebars main website. As well as the example code given by Rob. I read through the handlebars website and used that to establish my knowledge of what handlebars can do. Then I used the code given by Rob to get familiar with the syntax. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I had to google the correct way to deal with the data of twits, but ultimately found the way I was doing it was correct.

      The most challenging part of the assignment was conceptualizing how the server functioned, it was hard for me to wrap my head around the idea of putting the actual command that started the server last. In orde to combat this I just read and reread the lecture notes for node.js.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I learned more about how website hosting work as well as became much more familiar with with the general concept of http and how websites are serverd to the user. Even though this was possibly the easiest assignmnet I felt like it help me understand web development more than any other.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      For this one I was able to do the entire assignment just using the lecture notes as well as my memory of the lectures themselves. Being exposed to the workings of node.js in lecture got the ball rolling enough that I just needed to review the lecture notes for syntax as well as general understanding of the concepts.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I had to google the content-types so that I could add the .css and .js files to be included.Other than that it was all straight forward

	    The biggest challenge about with this assignment was getting a proper grasp of how javascript can interact with html. I ended up spending the most amount of time trying to figure out how to actually add the elements to the html page, I could easily create the elements, but just couldn't figure out how to get them onto the page. Of course I finally realized that I could treat the body like an element as well and add the elements as children.
		<br/>
	    <br/>
		I learned a lot about how javascript interacts with html. This was a very rewarding assignment that ended up teaching me lots of different techniques for tackling js. The most important lesson I learned was to use function programing instead of object oriented. Luckily this came fairly easily as I was already fairly familiar with function concepts, due to working with haskell. Sadly I did not pay very much attention in lecture so a lot of the learning of javascript came from this assignment. I also learned how horrible it is to have a case sensitive language.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The most helpful resource this time around was again <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a>. The site was very helpful for learning syntax. I also found the clas Piazza to be helpful for conquering the more conceptual sides of the assignment.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		I definitly had to google how to make the search box update as you type, ultimately finind the keyup event trigger. It was a farily difficult thing to google, and defiinitly took some digging. I also google how to add elements to the body of the page.

            This assignment acted as a pretty fast introduction to css, I was not familiar with cas at all really and that certainly lead to some confusion and struggles. I was expecting this assignment to be as light and simple as the first one, this was not the case at all and I was surprised by how much time I had to put in to get it done. However I think this really helped cement the basic of css.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I had a fair amount of problems figuring out the right margins/paddings, it was a lot of guess and check and ended with plenty of messy looking code. I found that the best way for me to solve the issue was to take break and step back for a while, I would clear out some of the code I had written and try to look at it from the outside in. This really helped clear my mind and let me understand what needed to be done much quicker. Beyond this I missed a couple lectures in the last weeks so I had a lot of catchup reading to do to give myself the understanding I needed of css.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I think honestly the biggest aha moment for me was learning how simple css really could be. I did not realize until the end that I could manual input the height, width, and position of the elements, realizing this changed how I looked at the issues, and let me finish the rest of the assignment much quicker. I also found that I had pretty good understanding of presidence going into the assignment.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This time the most useful resource was certainly the lectures, with the second most used being the css notes on the class website. I would occcasionaly use Piazza as it was helpful for some questions, another thing that was very useful was working through the example that could be found on the class page. I used the lecture as a base for my knowledge, and the notes as a refresher on this knowledge. The example code was great to get an idea of how to apply various things, and Piazza was excellent for specific questions that I shared with my classmates.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I definitly had to google how to make the tweet button a circle, I was able to get the circular shape but not able to get it to scale as I zoomed in. I found out about the ability to type vh and vw so that you could scale the width based off of the height, this made it trivial to create a good looking circle.

            Overall I found this first assignmnet to be a nice intro to html. I have had some experience with html
            but it was mostly just reading it and not really writing it. I do have to admit that the assignment was
            not very challenging. This was a good thing though as I feel first assignemtns should not be overwhelming.
            The largest issue I had was figuring out the proper syntax for the < img > and the < a href > tags as we
            had not yet gone over this at the time that I was working on the assignment. I was able to find the syntax
            for both on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a>, I choose this site as it was the first
            to come up when googling both of the tags. <br/> <br/>

            I learned a lot about specific tags and when to use them, into the assignment I already knew the general
            structure and look of html, as well as how to understand what is going on when reading it. But it is really
            interesting to actually make my own page. <br/> <br/>

            I also did not realize how websites where hosted and it was intresting to learn that it is just an html file
            stored in folder. (Im sure that most websites are at least a little more complex than this but stil it was
            pretty neat.) <br/> <br/>

            The only reasources I used were <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a> and the index.html file
            we made the second day in class, but they where both very helpful and vital to me finishing the assignment.
